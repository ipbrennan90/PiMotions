## Introduction

We're excited that you are joining us on **March 10, 2018** to dive into the wonders of the [Raspberry Pi Zero W](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/), the tiniest Raspberry Pi.

- In [Part 1](docs/part1.md) of this workshop, we're going to set up a web application that can take a picture using our Pi with the click of a button.
- In [Part 2](docs/part2.md), we will write code to detect motion using the camera connected to the Pi.

To make the workshop run as smoothly as possible, you'll need to complete the [prework](docs/prework.md) steps ahead of time.

## Overview
We're going to cover a lot of ground in this workshop. :tada:

By the end, you'll have your very own Pi Zero and camera to take home, and you'll know:
